I wanna make a supersonic man out of you<br>

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course<br>
I am a satellite I'm out of control<br>
I am a sex machine ready to reload<br>
Like an atom bomb about to Oh oh oh oh oh explode<br>
</p><p>

Two hundred degrees<br>
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit<br>
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light<br>
